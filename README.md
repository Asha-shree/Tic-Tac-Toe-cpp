# Tic-Tac-Toe-cpp
This is a code for the tic tac toe game where we have our configuration stored in a matrix
and we can extend into to any size by just changing the N value in the global variables section.
The code is written in C++ using the constructs like loops,conditional statements,switch cases and modular programming.
The code clearly has been modularised for each part of the game.
It is a multiplayer game where each player alternatively communicated through the prompts generated by the code on the command line interpreter.
